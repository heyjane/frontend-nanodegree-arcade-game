I used the following resources to complete project 3:

- Completed Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas courses on Udacity.

- Attended live Udacity office hours and watched recorded OH.

- Participated in study group sessions to discuss general concepts and project 3 specific concepts.

- Used MDN for specific coding references.

- Used Udacity guides for best practices.

- Used HipChat, Piazza, and the new Chat feature.

- Used Google searches to find resources on HTML5 canvas, game features (like movement and collisions), sprites, and deeper dive on related technical info.  Here are some of the most helpful sites I found:

- My twin 16-year-old sons were my game-testers.  When
they liked it, I was happy:)
