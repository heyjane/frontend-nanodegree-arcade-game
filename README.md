===============================

Welcome to "Bugger!" a Frogger-like game of avoiding enemy bugs to safely
cross the road.

As the welcome screen explains, your quest is to help Skeeter, Bugsy, and Princess
Gnatalie safely evade the evil buggers who are trying to keep them from the Magic
Waters.  You start your quest with three lives.  Each time you run into an evil
bugger, you lose one life.  Each time you successfully get to the Magic Waters,
you gain one life.  If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.

Level 1: Help Skeeter cross first.  Luckily, this is the easiest level as little
Skeeter is anemic and can't run too fast.

Level 2: Help Bugsy across.  Looks like the nasty buggers are bugged that Skeeter
got past them--they're moving faster now!

Level 3: Help Princess Gnatalie get to the Magic Waters.  Good thing she's been
working with the Royal Personal Trainer, because those buggers are hopping mad
now.  They're moving even faster!
